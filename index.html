        <h1>Synopsis</h1>

        <p>
          For the past thirty years Aden has devoted his life to fight aside
          England as the head knight during the Edwardian war. Aden creates a
          reputation for himself as the most vicious warrior on the battlefield
          only to protect a deep secret as hidden as possible. When the secret
          is exposed he is forced to strike a deal with a stranger to save his
          family. His soul is condemned to eternity as he is obligated to stand
          as the leader of a war unknown to mankind. When his family is taken
          from him, Aden is ashamed and defrauded by the deal he once believed
          was a gift. He sets upon a journey to rid of the curse which takes him
          across the world to Lithium City in the twentieth century. After
          centuries of searching, Aden finally finds a young man by the name of
          Josh Krestin. During a freak accident Josh becomes the new vessel for
          the curse that centuries ago was cast upon Aden. As Josh's life
          crumbles, he discovers abilities he believed impossible for any human
          to possess and a dark world he never knew that coexisted with the
          daily world he lives in. As a new life unfolds for him his old life
          starts to fade from existence. He soon encounters that the future he
          once desired and dreamed of, may no longer be his choice to make.

        <h1>About Mark</h1>

        <article>
          <p>
            My name is Mark Cindell, I’m a writer, debut author, gamer, blogger,
            foodie, etc. The list goes on and on. I found my passion and
            creativity when I was a kid after reading “Charlie and the Chocolate
            Factory” by Roald Dahl. I’m not lying when I say that by the age of
            twelve I had read this book at least minimum 10 times. The world
            that Mr. Dahl created, so colorful and adventurous, each character
            having their own distinctive personality. I felt as if I were
            sitting right there beside Charlie while he watched as each brat
            fall prey to their selfish greedy needs. I loved that book and still
            re-visit whenever I need to find inspiration. After this book, I
            started off writing short stories for school and some just for
            myself. Somehow as I grew, the ideas just got shoved aside and I
            stopped writing. One day at work, I don’t even remember how one of
            my many story ideas came up in a conversation, and a fellow
            co-worker said something I’d never forget: “If you have an idea,
            write it, not everybody can create worlds and characters, so if you
            can, why let it waste.” I followed those words which soon became the
            passion that pushed me to publish my debut novel:
            <strong>In Between</strong>

          </p>

          <p>Where were you born?</p>

          <p>
            I was born in Chicago Illinoise, close to humble park? it was a
            dangerouse yet very amazing place to grow up. A lot of gangs, yet I
            loved the school I attended, von humboldt school, I have very fond
            memories just like I have a few horrible ones. Just like anything in
            life, it had it's Pros & Cons
          </p>

          <p>What inspired you to become a writer?</p>

          <p>
            Due to the circumstances where I grew up in Chicago. Usually after
            school me and my brothers were on lockdown because of the violence
            just outside our doors. my alternatives to entertainment, were video
            games, TV and books. So I took turns with each. This is how I came
            across
            <strong>Roald Dahl's: Charlie & The Chocolate Factory</strong>
            . I couldnt get enough of this book, it was so colorful and vivid.
            The detail and level of imagination that was used to write that book
            was on a level of it's own. It's what sparked my interest towards
            writing. I wanted to reach that level of creativity in my own
            stories. It's the one book that every now and then I'll sit down and
            re-read, just to remind myself of why I started writing.
